There is a makefile in the Source folder

The makefile has three targets that are the three distinct main functions 
main_1D
main_2D
main_NN

The first two need to be linked to Eigen library (eigen/3.3.3 was used)
The last one also needs the link to the static library libopennn.a stored in the Libraries folder
