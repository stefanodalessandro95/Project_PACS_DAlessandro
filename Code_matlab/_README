This folder contains the matlab code for the project

The scripts Test1D and Test2D run the tests on the 1D function and 2D function respectively for all the four algorithms implemented 
The results are displayed with plots (as the 1D and 2D cases allow this possibility)

The specific values for the parameters can be set inside the scripts where the algorithms are implemented. 
The scripts are stored in the Algorithms folder. 

The Functions Folder contains the 2D functions and the function for the computation of the stochastic gradient.
